# Third-party model assets

## B601-RS D405 / D435i / Gemini 2 wrist assemblies

The former 30-degree D405 mount and primitive camera proxy have been removed.
The `wrist_*` mesh assets and generated sections in `rs_arm.xml` use the same
three upstream assemblies as the RS web console:

- Mounts and assembly positions: `xiehuangbao888/rebot_visual_grasp`, commit
  `dd28d65598deec767cf95fa45521d69b38155833` (package declares Apache-2.0).
- Mount CAD: Seeed-Projects/reBot-DevArm via Yang-Ci/Camera-Mounts,
  CERN-OHL-W-2.0.
- RealSense camera bodies: realsenseai/realsense-ros, commit
  `9215f26e8348ad5922a608b77882a9bfe05940f0`, Apache-2.0.
- Gemini 2 body: orbbec/OrbbecSDK_ROS2, commit
  `c153462518ad674650bafa4464fda72c27ab797a`, Apache-2.0.

Original sources, hashes, upstream links and full attribution are retained in
`reBotArm_simulator-RS/public/models/wrist-cameras/README.md` and `source.json`
at the repository root. License texts are also installed in `models/licenses/`.

`scripts/build_wrist_cameras.py` converts those URDF visual origins into fixed
geoms on `gripper_end`, retaining the source mount and camera transforms. STL
meshes are copied unchanged. The D435 Collada body is converted to binary STL
parts with its material colors and triangles preserved; large parts are split
to respect MuJoCo's 200,000-triangle STL limit.

The wrist RGB camera uses the selected model's color optical frame, converted
from ROS optical axes to MuJoCo camera axes. The common 62.82-degree simulation
vertical field of view is retained for all variants; it is not a calibration
of a physical device. Camera geoms are visual only and do not add collision,
mass or joints. Inactive variants have zero alpha and use hidden geom group 4.

To regenerate, install developer dependencies `numpy`, `scipy` and `pycollada`,
then run `python scripts/build_wrist_cameras.py` from this ROS package.
